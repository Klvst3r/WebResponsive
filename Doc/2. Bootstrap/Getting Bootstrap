less - path to Bootstrap's main Less source file
style - path to Bootstrap's non-minified CSS that's been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)

Skip the download with jsDelivr to deliver cached version of Bootstrap’s compiled CSS and JS to your project.

If you’re using our compiled JavaScript and prefer to include Popper separately, add Popper before our JS, via a CDN preferably.

Package managers
Pull in Bootstrap’s source files into nearly any project with some of the most popular package managers. No matter the package manager, Bootstrap will require a Sass compiler and Autoprefixer for a setup that matches our official compiled versions.

npm
Install Bootstrap in your Node.js powered apps with the npm package:

Copy
npm install bootstrap
const bootstrap = require('bootstrap') or import bootstrap from 'bootstrap' will load all of Bootstrap’s plugins onto a bootstrap object. The bootstrap module itself exports all of our plugins. You can manually load Bootstrap’s plugins individually by loading the /js/dist/*.js files under the package’s top-level directory.

Bootstrap’s package.json contains some additional metadata under the following keys:

sass - path to Bootstrap’s main Sass source file
style - path to Bootstrap’s non-minified CSS that’s been precompiled using the default settings (no customization)
Get started with Bootstrap via npm with our starter project! Head to the twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter template repository to see how to build and customize Bootstrap in your own npm project. Includes Sass compiler, Autoprefixer, Stylelint, PurgeCSS, and Bootstrap Icons.
yarn
Install Bootstrap in your Node.js powered apps with the yarn package:


yarn add bootstrap
RubyGems
Install Bootstrap in your Ruby apps using Bundler (recommended) and RubyGems by adding the following line to your Gemfile:


gem 'bootstrap', '~> 5.1.3'
Alternatively, if you’re not using Bundler, you can install the gem by running this command:


gem install bootstrap -v 5.1.3
See the gem’s README for further details.

Composer
You can also install and manage Bootstrap’s Sass and JavaScript using Composer:


composer require twbs/bootstrap:5.1.3
NuGet
If you develop in .NET, you can also install and manage Bootstrap’s CSS or Sass and JavaScript using NuGet:


Install-Package bootstrap

Install-Package bootstrap.sass
